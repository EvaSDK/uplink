How to Contribute to Uplink
***************************
The following is a guide for contributing to Uplink. Thanks for taking the
time to improve an open source project!

This guide is a work in progress. So, if you have suggestions for
improving the contributors' experience, the release process, or really
anything concerning the source code's management, please feel free to
contact `@prkumar <https://github.com/prkumar>`_ directly.

Reporting Bugs and Making Feature Requests
==========================================
We use the GitHub issue tracker for wrangling bug reports and feature requests.
Before you open an issue, please do a quick search against both **closed and
open** issues to ensure that the defect or feature request has not been
previously reported or addressed.

We use GitHub milestones to associate approved features and verified
defects to their respective target release versions (e.g., ``v1.0.0`` or
``v0.x``). Also, we use GitHub projects to group issues by long-term
enhancement efforts. (e.g., Support asynchronous requests`).

Feature Requests
----------------
As we're in initial development, the project is accepting feature requests!
To request a feature, open a GitHub issue, summarize the enhancement, and
add the **feature request** label.

Installation
============

Install all development dependencies using:

::

    $ pipenv install --dev
    $ pipenv run pre-commit install


If you are unfamiliar with pipenv_ but are comfortable with virtualenvs_,
you can alternatively run ``pip install pipenv`` inside the virtualenv you are
already using then invoke the commands from above. This will setup your
virtualenv correctly.

.. _pipenv: https://docs.pipenv.org/
.. _virtualenvs: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

Before submitting a pull request, run all tests with tox_:

::

    $ tox

.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Making Changes to the Source
============================
To find a feature or bug to work on, checkout the open GitHub issues with the
label "`help wanted
<https://github.com/prkumar/uplink/labels/help%20wanted>`_".
Once you have found an issue that you'd like to work on, add a comment to the
issue expressing your interest in developing the feature or fixing the bug, and
mention `@prkumar <https://github.com/prkumar>`_ in your comment.

Moreover, changes to the source code typically address one of the following:

* `Feature enhancement or minor bug fix`_
* `Critical bug fix`_

And, their development typically follows this workflow:

1. Fork the repository if you don't have write-access.
2. Make your changes, adhering to the `style guide`_.
3. Add or update tests_.
4. Update documentation, if necessary.
5. Add yourself to `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_.
6. When your changes are ready for review, open a `pull request`_.
7. Merge changes.


Development Process
===================
In this section, we'll outline the various development stages of Uplink.
And, as the development process and branching model go hand-in-hand, we'll
also cover how our branching workflow ties into each stage.

To start off, let's address the two, everlasting branches: ``stable`` and
``master``.

``stable``
----------
As the production branch, this branch should be the most stable branch.
Nominally, ``stable`` strictly contains merge commits, each tagged with
a release version (e.g, ``v0.1.0``). See releases_ for more on how we
handle the releasing process.

``master``
-----------
This branch contains work-in-progress for the next immediate release.

Feature Enhancement or Minor Bug Fix
------------------------------------
Subject to inclusion in some future release, features are logically
cohesive units of work that add value to Uplink. In like manner, fixing
a minor bug adds value by addressing a value destroying characteristic
of the code, a defect.

Further, a minor bug is a defect that we can wait to patch in a coming
minor or major release. A defect that requires immediate attention needs
a `critical bug fix`_.

Development of a feature or a minor bug fix should happen on a
feature branch, which contains work for the next or some distant
release. To start a feature branch, branch off of ``master``. Preferably,
prefix the branch name with ``feature/`` (or ``feature/v{version}/``, where
{version} is the feature's target release version -- e.g., ``feature/v1.0
.0/*``) for clarity. Make your changes on this branch, then when ready
to merge, open a `pull request`_ against ``master``.

Importantly, if your changes are not targeted for the next immediate
release, keep them on the feature branch until ``master`` is bumped to
the target version. However, you may open a pull request beforehand.

Also, after we have merged your changes into ``master``, you should
delete your feature branch, to keep the Git repository uncluttered.

Critical Bug Fix
----------------
Critical bugs are defects affecting the latest released version of Uplink and
require immediate action (i.e., we can't wait and patch the defect in a coming
major or minor release). We assign the label
"`critical <https://github.com/prkumar/uplink/labels/critical>`_" to GitHub
issues tracking critical bugs.

To address a critical bug, we need to:

1. Create a hotfix branch off ``stable``.
2. Increment the patch number.
3. Implement a fix.
4. Open `pull request`_ against ``master``, and another against ``stable``.

Releases
--------
Once we're ready to begin the release process, we'll create a release branch
off an appropriate commit of ``master``. The name of a release branch
should follow the pattern ``release/v{version}``, where ``{version}`` is the
target release version number (e.g., ``release/v1.0.0``).

Once the release branch is merged into ``stable``, we consider the release
completed. However, up until this point, we can make necessary changes to
the release branch, while normal feature development continues on ``master``.

When merging the release branch into ``stable``, perform an explicit,
non fast-forward **merge**. Then, on the the merge commit in ``stable``,
create a tag named ``v{version}``, where ``{version}`` is the target
release version number (e.g., ``v1.0.0``). Tagging the commit prompts Travis
CI to deploy the latest release to PyPI.

Notably, before removing a release branch, we'll need to merge the
branch into ``master`` to incorporate commits made after the release
branch was cut. Moreover, once a release branch is cut, we need to bump
the version number on ``master``.

Pull Request
============
Depending on the type of change you are making, the branching model may
require merging your work into one or two target branches (typically one is
``master``). Be sure to open a pull request for each target branch.

1. Open a pull request (PR) to merge your forked branch, the
   **candidate**, into a **base** branch of this repository.
2. Add Raj (``prkumar``) as a reviewer.
3. If your PR fails the Travis CI check, investigate the build log for
   cause of failure, address locally, and update the candidate branch. Repeat
   this step until the PR passes the Travis CI check.
4. If your PR fails the Codecov check, check the PR's Codecov report
   to identify modules experiencing a test coverage drop. Improve testing
   locally, then update the candidate branch.
5. Once all checks have passed and the assigned reviewers have approved,
   a maintainer will merge your pull requests into the base branch by
   selecting "Merge Pull Request" (i.e., a ``--no-ff`` merge).
6. If the base branch fails the Travis CI build ran immediately following
   your merge, revert the merge commit, address the issue locally, update the
   candidate branch, then revisit step 3.

Tests
=====
We use the unit testing framework ``pytest``. Kept under the `tests`
directory, unit tests are written in Python modules with the filename
pattern ``test_*.py``.

Notably, ``conftest.py`` defines several `pytest fixtures
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html>`_, for injecting an
instance of an interface (defined in ``uplink.interfaces``) or utility
(defined in ``uplink.helpers``) class into your tests.

Style Guide
===========
To maintain a consistent code style with the rest of Uplink, follow the `Google
Python Style Guide`_.

Notably, we use a Sphinx plugin that can parse docstrings adherent to this
style. Checkout `this page
<http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
for examples of Google Python Style Guide docstrings.
